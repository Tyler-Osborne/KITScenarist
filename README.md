Dear friends!

We are looking forward to presenting you our new project - [Story Architect](https://github.com/story-apps/starc). This is an evolution of our popular KIT Scenarist program, which will become your indispensable assistant in creating the best scripts.

Unfortunately, we have to archive the KIT Scenarist repository due to a complete switch to a new project. However, we are ready to offer you a more up-to-date and evolving version of our program, which will become your reliable partner in creative endeavors.

If you are interested in learning more about the reasons for the transition and the differences between the projects, you can read the information at [this article](https://kitscenarist.ru/en/history/2023-06-06.html). We hope that this information will help you better understand our work and decide whether to continue using our products. Thank you for your attention, and we look forward to seeing you on the new repository!

Story Architect is a powerful tool for creating scenarios of any complexity. Our program will help you develop an idea, build the structure of the script, create characters and much more. All this is available in a user-friendly and intuitive interface that will help you keep your creative energy and focus on the most important thing - creating the best script.

We apologize for any inconvenience this change may cause. However, we are confident that our new project will be a great success.
